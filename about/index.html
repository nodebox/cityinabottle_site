<h1>What is &quot;City In A Bottle&quot;?</h1><p class="big">City In A Bottle is an interactive project bordering between art, science and games, funded by the Flemish Audiovisual Fund.</p><p>The game environment is based on the principle of <i>emergence</i> (Goldstein, 1999). Organisms (plants and insects) start off with basic behaviouristic rules and goals. If an opponent is edible, attack it. If an opponent is stronger, flee. When cornered, fight back. Hide in a flock of relatives to minimize the chance of being singled out. Follow a food trail marked by a relative. Expand and defend a productive environment. Grow colourful feathers/flowers to incite reproduction.</p><p>Complex social behavior then emerges by itself as organisms interact with each other. Species with a good strategy will survive and evolve over time, will adapt, will look different. The gaming enviroment changes procedurally, there is no preprogrammed story or pathway. We don't control the biotope. The creatures will find their own way and either co-exist or fight for limited space and food.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr size="2" width="100%" /><h1>Who is involved?</h1><p>We have a small interdisciplinary team of artists, computer scientists, a biologist and a psychologist working on City In A Bottle.
