	<p>Funny.&nbsp; I've stumbled across a game that uses the same principles of emergent behaviour, but targeted at one single item of gameplay, namely weapons.Galactic Arms Race is a multiplayer spaceshooter.&nbsp; Nothing special there, until you come to the weapons section.&nbsp; The lasers have not been designed, but are generated by ...</p>
